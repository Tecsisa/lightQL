## Acknowledgments

The lightQL team is especially grateful to [@lihaoyi][lihaoyi-github] for his [fastparse][fastparse-github]
library whose combinators have been extensively used in the parsing part. Likewise,
it deserves special mention [@sksamuel][sksamuel-github] and his [elastic4s][elastic4s-github-url] library that makes Scala developers' life
easier when it comes to working with Elasticsearch.
