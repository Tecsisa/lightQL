# Contribution policy

Contributions via GitHub pull requests are gladly accepted from their original author.
Along with any pull requests, please state that the contribution is your original work
and that you license the work to the project under the project's open source license.
Whether or not you state this explicitly, by submitting any copyrighted material via pull request,
email, or other means you agree to license the material under the project's open source license and
warrant that you have the legal authority to do so.

Please make sure to follow these conventions:

* For each contribution there must be a ticket (GitHub issue) with a short descriptive name, e.g. "Support for delegated functions"
* Work should happen in a branch named "ISSUE-DESCRIPTION", e.g. "32-functions-support"
* Before a PR can be merged, all commits must be squashed into one with its message made up from the ticket name and the ticket id, e.g. "Support for delegated functions (closes #32)"
