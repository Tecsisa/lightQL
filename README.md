**lightQL** is a minimal external search DSL that compiles to Scala. Used in conjunction
with [elastic4s](https://github.com/sksamuel/elastic4s),
lightQL can deliver a better developer experience regarding the work with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch),
especially in simple scenarios where advanced search capabilities are not required.

Please, visit the [documentation](https://tecsisa.github.io/lightQL/) site for details
about how to use it and the motivation to build it.

lightQL has been developed and open sourced by [Tecsisa](http://www.tecsisa.com/). Everyone is welcome to participate
